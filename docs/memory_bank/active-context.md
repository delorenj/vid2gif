# Current Context

## Ongoing Tasks

- Create Rust CLI app 'vid2gif' for video to GIF conversion
- Implement command-line interface with --loop, --speed, --input, --output flags
- Use ffmpeg backend for video processing
- Package as installable binary
## Known Issues
- [Issue 1]
- [Issue 2]

## Next Steps

- Initialize Rust project structure
- Implement CLI argument parsing with clap
- Create ffmpeg wrapper for video conversion
- Add error handling and validation
- Test with sample WebM files
## Current Session Notes

- [3:11:06 PM] [Unknown User] Completed Rust CLI application 'vid2gif': Successfully created and deployed a Rust CLI tool for video to GIF conversion with the exact interface requested:
- Built with Rust using clap for CLI parsing, tokio for async operations, and anyhow for error handling
- Implements --loop, --speed, --input, --output flags as specified
- Uses ffmpeg backend with optimized settings for quality GIF conversion
- Includes comprehensive error handling, validation, and user feedback
- Supports all major video formats and provides file size comparison
- Installed system-wide at /usr/local/bin/vid2gif
- Includes unit tests and comprehensive documentation
- [Note 1]
- [Note 2]
